# logistic-regression-and-adaboost-for-classification  

This repository contains all the programs coded and reports prepared for the assignment on classification using logistic regression and AdaBoost **(Offline-1)**.  



## navigation  

- `report/` folder contains a `README.md` file describing steps to run the script and reporting performance evaluation of the implementation on different datasets.  
- `spec/` folder contains specification for this particular assignment.  
- `src/` folder contains a Jupyter notebook (with `.ipynb` extension) and a Python script (with `.py` extension obviously) both containing implementation of logistic regression as well as AdaBoost and code for datasets preprocessing.
